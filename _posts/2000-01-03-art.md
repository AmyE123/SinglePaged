<h1>Art is fun!</h1>
<h4>I really like to <strong>illustrate</strong> things from my favorite video games and anime, as well as <strong>design</strong> new things!</h4>
<p>I love looking through concept art for games, and seeing the design process from picking colour schemes to designing outfits! I've been doing art since I was in school, doodling in my sketchbooks and filling them up one after the other, it's really fun to go back through them and see my improvement over time!</p>
<p>Since August of 2020, I've begun doing commission work! Drawing and designing characters for many clients! This has gone so much better than I thought it would! And it's so much fun to do!</p>
<p>I've not got a website for my art yet, it's a work in progress, but for now, you can view my artwork on my social media(s) below.</p>
