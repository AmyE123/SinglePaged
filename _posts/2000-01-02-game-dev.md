<h1>I love video games!</h1>
<h4>And some other things I really enjoy are <strong>technology</strong> and <strong>being creative!</strong> And games development is exactly that!</h4>
<p>I'm a programmer and I've worked some programming jobs in the Games Industry, as well as being on a Games Technology University course.</p>
<p>In my Games Dev blog I talk about all the different stuff I've done and the different games I've worked on!</p>
