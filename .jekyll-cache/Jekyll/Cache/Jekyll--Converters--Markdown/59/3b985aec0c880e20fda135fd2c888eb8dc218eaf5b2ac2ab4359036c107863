I"<h1>This is like a personal diary!</h1>
<p>I really enjoy blogging, so for anything that wouldn't go in my game development blogs or art blogs, they would go here, so this would be things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Japanese Blogs</li>
  <li>Fashion Blogs</li>
  <li>And other stuff I feel like writing about!</li>
</ul>

<p>See you there!</p>
